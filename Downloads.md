# Running the Code #

---


  * Unzip the data directories in the directory containing directories for motion and color orientation code
  * In Matlab, to run the code for motion or color orientation, enter the respective motion or color orientation code directories
  * Then use the following command and press enter

```
  >> process("SVM",4,1)
```

  * The rest of the code should follow through

## NOTE ##

  * one might want to compile the svmlearn and svm classify files from SVMLight package in gcc before executing the above process function in matlab
  * to walk through the code, use debugger
  * there are parts of the code that have not been implemented. One can insert changes to one's personal copy to extend the work

  * _Decoding Spatiotemporal fMRI Activation Patterns Via Kernels_ [Reference-Link](http://www.cs.uu.nl/groups/ADA/studentproj/spatiotemp-fmri.php)
  * Please wait for the bioliography as there are refinements that need to be made in the thesis work. A copy exists on researchgate. In case of use of a part or full of the thesis, please make the necessary citaions.
  * Bibtex ... yet to come
