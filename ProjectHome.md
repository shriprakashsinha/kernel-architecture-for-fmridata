Discovering patterns from noisy fMRI recordings poses challenging hurdles for machine learning based decoding methods. A novel kernel architecture is proposed which uses local spatial knowledge and approximated temporal signal behaviour to reveal activation patterns from complex fMRI spatiotemporal data. After encoding these patterns via a distance metric, the information is embedded in a kernel matrix. By employing kernel based learning algorithms like support vector machines (SVMs) and Parzen window based classifiers (PWCs) spread over a directed acyclic graphical (DAG) framework for multiclass classification problem, prediction accuracies increased profoundly in comparison to those obtained using spatial or temporal information, exclusively. At the cost of loss of geometrical interpretation, this study reveals that kernels become indefinite while enhancing the prediction accuracies of the perceived stimuli. Although this study was not specifically designed for revealing the function of visual areas in representing motion attributes, the results indicate that high levels of accuracy can be obtained when one uses areas of visual cortex for the prediction of perceived motion stimuli. **Keywords** : fMRI, Activation Pattern, Visual Stimuli, Similarity Measure, Kernel Methods, Classication
